Package: com.compilingentropy.fuzzycactus
Name: Fuzzycactus
Version: 0.1.0.3
Description: Automated MobileSafari Fuzzer
	A tool which automates and simplifies the on-device fuzzing of MobileSafari.

	How it works: This tool can turn anyone's freshly jailbroken device into a fuzzing machine in minutes. All the setup is handled for you.

	Usage: 
	~$ fuzzycactus start /path/to/file
	~$ fuzzycactus stop
	~$ fuzzycactus help

	The working directory for this tool is /private/var/fuzzycactus/, you can see your results and crashes in there.

	Start and stop the script over ssh (rather than mobileterminal) to avoid confusing the device as it does its work. Once the script is started you can safely disconnect.

	Always remember: Before you begin fuzzing, go to 'Settings' > 'General' > 'About' > 'Diagnostics & Usage' and check the "Don't Send" option. Otherwise, all your hard work will go to Apple and you will be sad. =(
