Package: com.compilingentropy.fuzzycactus
Name: Fuzzycactus
Version: 2.0.6-1
Description: Automated MobileSafari Fuzzer
	<html>
	<div align="left">
	<p>A tool which automates and simplifies the on-device fuzzing of MobileSafari.
	<p>How it works: This tool can turn anyone's freshly jailbroken device into a fuzzing machine in minutes. All the setup is handled for you.
	<br>
	Usage:
	<p>fuzzycactus [action] [file] [options]
	<p>fuzzycactus [start/stop/watch/help] [./file.mov] [-s] [-t 11] [-r 0.0001:0.001] [-k]
	<p>~$ fuzzycactus start ./file.mov
	<p>~$ fuzzycactus stop
	<p>~$ fuzzycactus watch
	<p>~$ fuzzycactus help
	<br>
	The working directory for this tool is /private/var/fuzzycactus/, you can see your results and crashes in there.
	<p>Start and stop the script over ssh (rather than mobileterminal) to avoid confusing the device as it does its work.
	<p>Once the script is started you can safely disconnect.
	<br>
	Always remember: Before you begin fuzzing, go to 'Settings' > 'General' > 'About' > 'Diagnostics & Usage' and check the "Don't Send" option.
	<p>Otherwise, all your hard work will go to Apple and you will be sad. =(
